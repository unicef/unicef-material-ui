# UNICEF material-ui

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40unicef%2Fmaterial-ui.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40unicef%2Fmaterial-ui)

Customized version for UNICEF of [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/). Material UI is a set of [ReactJS](http://reactjs.org) user interface components based on [Google's material design](https://material.io/design/) written in Javascript.

You can see a **[Demo site](https://unicef.github.io/unicef-material-ui/example/)** and the **[reference documentation](https://unicef.github.io/unicef-material-ui/)**.

## Getting started

In order to use the UNICEF's Material UI components in your React project install the npm package.

```bash
 npm install @unicef/material-ui
```

## Usage

### Adding UNICEF theme to your app

To use UNICEF theme add `MuiThemeProvider` at the top level of your app and warp you components inside `UNICEFStyleProvider`

```jsx
// App.js
import React from 'react'
import MuiThemeProvider from '@material-ui/core/styles/MuiThemeProvider'
import { theme, UNICEFStyleProvider } from '@unicef/material-ui'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <MuiThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <UNICEFStyleProvider>
        {/* Components*/}
      </UNICEFStyleProvider>
    </MuiThemeProvider>
  )
}
```
